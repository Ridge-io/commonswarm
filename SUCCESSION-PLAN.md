# cloud-swarm — Lead succession & build plan

**Read this first if you are a new Lead.** This is the durable baton-pass for the
cloud-swarm build. It is version-controlled so every Lead updates it before
rotating out. If you are picking this up, you are the current Lead — adopt the
succession protocol below for yourself.

---

## 0. The succession protocol (do this for yourself too)

The operator's standing rule: **when your context reaches ~60% utilization or
more, rotate out.** To rotate:

1. Get the current phase to a **clean, committed, green checkpoint** (never hand
   off mid-file or on red tests).
2. **Update this file** — status, what's done, what's next, any in-flight work
   (background reviews, dispatched agents) with how to collect their results.
3. Commit it. Then spawn / designate a **fresh Lead** and point it at this file,
   or tell the operator you've hit the rotation point and P<n> is a clean
   checkpoint for the next Lead to resume from.
4. The successor Lead **inherits this same protocol.**

Rotate at a **phase boundary** whenever possible — it's the cleanest resume point.

## 1. Model & delegation policy (operator directive)

- **Lead role = Fable-class** (scarce; **reserved for Leads only**). You are the Lead.
- **Fable-class *subagent* work → Kimi K3**, NOT Fable (we are low on Fable tokens).
  Spec/design authoring, adversarial correctness/security review, hard reasoning:
  `opencode run --pure -m openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k3 --dir <repo> "<prompt>"`.
- **Workhorse implementation → Codex / Grok** (`codex exec -C <git-dir> -s read-only
  --skip-git-repo-check -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=xhigh "<prompt>"`
  for review; workspace-write to build). Always prepend the "do NOT invoke any
  skill/SKILL.md" override, or Codex gets hijacked by gstack skills.
- **Provisioning / anything you'd ask the operator to do** (create Supabase project,
  GitHub App, OAuth grants, DNS, deploys, entering credentials) → **delegate to the
  OpenClaw and Hermes A2A agents** (they act with the operator's authority; they are
  registered A2A agents reachable via the swarm). Do NOT enter credentials yourself.
- **Dispatch hygiene:** never `nohup ... &` inside a `run_in_background` Bash call —
  it orphans the child. Let the tool own backgrounding. Codex needs a git-repo
  workdir (`--skip-git-repo-check` if not). Strip ANSI from opencode logs
  (`sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g'`).

## 2. Method

Build **phase by phase**, each phase: **build → test (green) → model-inversion
review (Kimi K3) → integrate findings → commit** (evidence-gated completion; a
"done" claim needs the artifact — passing tests, a commit SHA). Use **ultracode /
the Workflow tool** for larger phases (fan-out implementers + adversarial
verifiers) — the operator has opted in for this project. Externalize state
continuously (this file + commits) — assume your session can die at any moment.

## 3. Ground facts

- **Repo:** `/Users/yulanbot/Developer/Ridge.io/cloud-swarm` (local git). **No remote yet** —
  create private (`gh repo create cloud-swarm --private --source=. --remote=origin`,
  or have OpenClaw/Hermes do it). Latest commit is the P0 checkpoint.
- **Why a separate repo:** the in-use local `swarm` CLI (coordinating the live
  PromptEden program) builds and runs from **its own working tree**
  (`~/Developer/Ridge.io/swarm`, `dist/index.js`); a broken build there (`rm -rf dist
  && tsc`) would kill the live tool. cloud-swarm is forked so cloud work can never do
  that. **Never build or churn the swarm repo's working tree to serve cloud work.**
- **SaaS domain:** `b9rk.com` (invite/board URLs → `swarm.b9rk.com` or similar; wire
  into the spec's `swarm.<domain>` placeholders when P5/hosting is designed).
- **Spec (canonical):** `docs/design/SWARM-CLOUD.md` — multi-model-reviewed; the §0
  design ethos (*friction is justified only by irreversibility*; smooth UX +
  invisible-but-hard authority) is the interpretive frame. The "It just works
  refactor — review ledger" (R1–R16) records the last review round.
- **Memory:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-yulanbot-Developer-Ridge-io/memory/` —
  `swarm-cloud-spec.md` (spec status), `tom-operator-visibility-constraint.md`,
  `prompteden-swarm-program.md`. Update `swarm-cloud-spec.md` as you go.

## 4. Phase status

- **P0-local — DONE, green, committed.** `src/protocol/` = reducer-complete §2.2
  authority core (events, reducer, commands=`decide()`, idempotency, upcasters),
  pure/no-I/O. `tests/protocol-next.test.ts` = 26 property tests pass; `tsc --noEmit`
  clean. **In flight:** a Kimi K3 correctness review of the core — log at
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-yulanbot-Developer-Ridge-io/c915fd5b-957d-437d-83d7-47d3cdd4dc79/scratchpad/kimi-p0-review.log`
  (task id `bjlv3sxq6`). **Next Lead: collect it, integrate any FIX findings, re-run
  tests, commit.**
- **P0-github — NOT STARTED (operator-gated → OpenClaw/Hermes):** GitHub rulesets on
  the coordinated repos, read-only GitHub App install + verify, doctrine-backstop
  (`docs/design/repo-backstop.md`) install into repo AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md via the
  PromptEden Lead (md-only draft PRs). There is an open swarm task
  `repo-doctrine-backstop` in the `default` swarm for the backstop install.
- **P1 — Secure authority slice (needs provisioning):** PKCE login + keychain;
  tenancy + private-schema command API wrapping `decide()`; repo mapping + named
  landing authority; audit; revocation; rate limits; invite flow. **Provisioning
  (Supabase project, GitHub App) → OpenClaw/Hermes.** Wire the P0 `decide()` core
  behind the Supabase command function — that is the whole point of building it pure.
- **P2–P5:** per spec §9. P5 = public free-to-start SaaS on b9rk.com.

## 5. Queued design tasks (don't lose these)

- **Add the "Access plane" track to the spec** (operator approved). A key-less
  secrets broker + policy egress proxy so agents operate third-party services
  without holding raw keys. **Three tiers by reversibility** (same §0 principle):
  1. **Read proxy (fluid):** scoped read capability → swarm proxies the call with the
     real key held server-side (Sentry issues, PostHog). Raw key never touches the
     agent/model. Reversible → low friction.
  2. **Leased local secrets (medium):** short-lived scoped secret **injected into the
     collaborator's local process at runtime** (not written to `.env`); revoke
     centrally. Honest residual risk: a malicious local dep could read an injected
     secret — reduces sprawl, not perfect containment.
  3. **Brokered infra ops (hard):** prod/dev Supabase migration, deploy → the §2.10
     Swarm-mediated-apply gate (secret released only after a fresh human approval
     bound to the exact op + environment, audited). Irreversible → hard.
  **Non-negotiable invariant:** an **egress allowlist** — the proxy calls ONLY the
  real service endpoints, never arbitrary URLs, or it becomes an exfiltration channel
  (lethal-trifecta amplifier). Rides the SAME capability/token/tenancy/audit model —
  which is why it's a clean extension. **Sequence it AFTER the coordination core is
  dogfooded** (its own track, architected-for now; the §2.10 secret-custody is the seed).
  Slot as spec §2.14 or a new "Access plane" section + a §9 track, mirroring the SaaS track.
- Start the **dedicated cloud-swarm swarm** (operator wants a project-specific swarm
  with the Lead as lead) and register OpenClaw/Hermes for provisioning.

## 6. Guardrails (from memory / operator)

- Secrets never in model-visible files. Draft-PR-only CI (Actions budget). Never
  `git clean` / `git add .` at the **Ridge.io root** (zero-commit trap) — cloud-swarm
  is a separate repo and is safe. Nothing provisioned until the operator's intent is
  clear (now delegated to OpenClaw/Hermes). Agents visible in cmux; spawned
  permission-free by default on this trusted machine.
